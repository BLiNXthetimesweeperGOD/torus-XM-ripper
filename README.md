# torus-XM-ripper
A Python-based tool for ripping GBA games made by Torus Games to XM

Please note that a few of their games won't work because they use a different sound driver. Don't make issues if a game throws the DPAK file error.

## Currently tested games
- Curious George
- Fantastic 4: Flame On
- Gumby Vs. the Astrobots
- Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing

## Usage instructions
- Run the script 
- Select your ROM file

In the same folder as the ROM you ran it on, there should now be a folder that has XM files in it.

## How to use the output XM files
Playing XM files can be done with the following programs:
- Foobar2000 with either the ZXTune plugin or the OpenMPT Module Decoder plugin
- OpenMPT (you can also edit them with this)

## Usage rights
Feel free to use any part of this tool (minus the output XM files, as they're copyrighted) in almost any project you'd like.

My only request is that you do not charge people for it.
