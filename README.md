# torus-XM-ripper
A Python-based tool for ripping GBA games made by Torus Games to XM

Please note that a few of their games won't work because they use a different sound driver. Don't make issues if a game throws the DPAK file error.

Currently tested games:
- Curious George
- Fantastic 4: Flame On
- Gumby Vs. the Astrobots
- Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing

## Usage rights
Feel free to use any part of this tool (minus the output XM files, as they're copyrighted) in almost any project you'd like.

My only request is that you do not charge people for it.
